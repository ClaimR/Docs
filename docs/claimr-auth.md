You can use ClaimR Auth as a two-factor authentication (2FA) solution to protect your online accounts, for example your Google, Facebook, Amazon or Twitter account.
When registering ClaimR Auth as your 2FA solution at a service, you can configure the area in which you can fullfill the authentication request.
