To simplify integrating with the ClaimR API on Android devices there's the ClaimR React Native Client.
This client handles collecting raw GNSS measurements and submitting the data to the ClaimR API.

We believe that it's important that you trust and own the code you are adding to your app.
Hence, the React Native client is released under a permissive open-source licence.
If there's anything you would like changed, then please feel free to open an issue on Github.
