## Fraud

Unveiler offers developers an easy method to verify the location provided by a user, which combats fraud through spoofing. Raw GNSS measurements are send to the Unveiler API which checks whether the user really is at the location they claim, or think, to be.

## Authorization

Previously location based authorization required some form of physical verification, e.g. connecting to a certain WiFi network. Our location verification technology allows developers to trust the location claimed by users for any outdoor location and many indoor locations. This unprecedented improvement gives rise to a whole new range of applications where users should only be granted access to certain data or content when they are in a certain area.

## Privacy

Unveiler lets your users create cryptographically secured "claims" about their location. Claims allows users to prove something about their location without exposing their exact location. A claim could be that the user is within a certain area, e.g. a certain garden, city, or continent. Only Unveiler would have had access to the exact location of the user while granting the claim.
