Usage of the ClaimR API is **free of charge for development and prototype purposes** for up to 250 location verification attempts per month. If developing for your use-case demands a higher limit, then please reach out to [sales@claimr.tools](mailto:sales@claimr.tools) such that we can temporarily increase your limit.

For production usage we have a usage based tiered pricing model, which charges based on the amount of successful verified location attempts.

| Requests per month | Price             |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 0 - 50             | Free tier         |
| 51 - 1k            | â‚¬0.09 per request |
| 1k - 10k           | â‚¬0.07 per request |
| 10k - 100k         | â‚¬0.05 per request |
| 100k+              | Custom pricing    |

## Example

For example, 25,000 verified location requests made during one month would cost â‚¬1465.50:

| Requests per month | Price              | Amount |       Cost |
