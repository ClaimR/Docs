This repository hosts the developer website for [Unveiler](https://unveiler.io). It introduces developers to what Unveiler offers, how to get started, documents all available features and hosts our blog.

## Contributing

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
